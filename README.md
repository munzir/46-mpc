### Optional Dependency

For simulation:

- [41-krang-sim-ach](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/41-krang-sim-ach)
 Install the repository.

## Compilation

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

## Usage

In order to run with a simulation, follow instructions in [41-krang-sim-ach](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/41-krang-sim-ach) to launch the ach channels and processes required before this program is run. Then in the build folder of this repo, type:

    sudo ./01-balancing

Press `Enter` for the program to start running. Press `s` then `Enter` to enable wheel control. Use joystick and keyboard to manipulate the robot. I will write instructions on joystick and keyboard functions later. For now, refer to `events.cpp` file to see what buttons of joystick and keyboard perform what functionality.
